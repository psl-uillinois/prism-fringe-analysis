# Prism fringe analysis

This project contains code for automatically analyzing images taken of fringe patterns, detecting the average
peak spacing, and converting that peak spacing into a refractive index. Helper functions are provided in
`analyze_single_prism.py`, complete analysis functions are provided in `analyze_all_prisms.py` (and related files),
and plotting code is provided in `plot_all_prisms.py` (and related files).
